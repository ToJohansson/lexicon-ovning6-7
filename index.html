          About: Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen), a rather clueless police
          detective, tries to foil a plot to turn innocent people into assassins
          through mind control. After his partner, Norberg (O.J. Simpson), is
          shot, Frank sets out to find the culprit, leading him to business
          tycoon Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalban). However, Frank has no
          evidence until he meets Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley), Ludwig's
          assistant. She knows nothing about Ludwig's devious plans, but falls
          for Frank and agrees to help him.
